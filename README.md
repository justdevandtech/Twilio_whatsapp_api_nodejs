## Twilio App with node(express.js)# Twilio_whatsapp_api_nodejs

For this App to work, WhatsApp has to formally approve your account. But, that doesn't mean you have to wait to start building. Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp lets you test your app in a developer environment.

To begin testing, connect to your sandbox by sending a WhatsApp message from your device to +1 415 523 8886 with code **join secret-hide.
